# Handle returned string with Http in Angular 2+, Ionic 3+ 

Example project show how we can get body of response object from Http component. My student asked me what to do if the Web API returned string instead of JSON. 

Thank you StudioLE from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36087145/how-can-i-get-access-to-the-angular-2-http-response-body-without-converting-it-t). This project implemented solution with Ionic Framework, for Android and iOS development!
